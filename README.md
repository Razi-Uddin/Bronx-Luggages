namely **Bronx Luggage** our first semester E-Project. We tried to
observe the coding and its outlook on Dreamweaver. We find it easy to
utilize the editor.

We would like to thank **Sir Sohail Shah** for their guidance and for
giving us time from their busy schedule.

We also express our sincere gratitude to E-Project team from Aptech Head
Office, for their valuable guidance and support for the completion of

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

The thirst for learning, upgrading technical skills and applying the
concepts in real

life environment at a fast pace is what the industry demands from IT
professionals

today. However busy work schedules, far-flung locations, unavailability
of convenient

time-slots pose as major barriers when it comes to applying the concepts
into

realism. And hence the need to look out for alternative means of
implementation in

the form of laddered approach.

The above truly pose as constraints especially for our students too!
With their busy

schedules, it is indeed difficult for our students to keep up with the
genuine and

constant need for integrated application which can be seen live
especially so in the

field of IT education where technology can change on the spur of a
moment. Well,

technology does come to our rescue at such times!!

Keeping the above in mind and in tune with our constant endeavour to use

Technology in our training model, we at Aptech have thought of
revolutionizing the

way our students learn and implement the concepts using tools themselves
by

providing a live and synchronous eProject learning environment!

So what is this eProject?

eProject is a step-by-step learning environment that closely simulates
the classroom

and Lab based learning environment into actual implementation. It is a
project

implementation at your fingertips!! An electronic, live juncture on the
machine that

allows you to

o Practice step by step i.e. laddered approach.

o Build a larger more robust application.

o Usage of certain utilities in applications designed by user.

o Single program to unified code leading to a complete application.

o Learn implementation of concepts in a phased manner.

o Enhance skills and add value.

o Work on real life projects.

o Give a real life scenario and help to create applications more
complicated and

useful.

o Mentoring through email support.

The students at the centre are expected to complete this eProject and
send complete

project along with the documentation to eProjects Team

Looking forward to a positive response from your end!!

**Objectives of the project**

The Objective of this program is to give a sample project to work on
real life

projects. These applications help you build a larger more robust
application.

The objective is not to teach you JSON/JavaScript/Dreamweaver/HTML5 but
to

provide you with a real life scenario and help you create basic
applications using the

tools.

You can revise the chapters before you start with the project.

This project is meant for students who have completed the module of
HTML5. These

programs should be done in the Lab sessions with assistance of the
faculty if

required.

It is very essential that a student has a clear understanding of the
subject. Students

should go through the project and solve the assignments as per
requirements given.

Kindly get back to eProjects Team in case of any doubts regarding the
application or

its objectives.
